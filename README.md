# Acousticrypt
Acousticrypt is a project created by myself and Neal Bayya that allows you to communicate text through audio.

Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deQp4SZw7_E

The app allows you to enter text and press Encode. This sends the text as a high-frequency audio file to the computer. We then record the audio from the computer to the phone and see if the phone can decode the text from the audio.

We do this by using an Android app for the interface, and a Flask API that handles logic for encoding text as audio, and decoding the audio back to text.

Check out ``Acousticrypt_Poster.pdf`` to see our project poster, which explains the motivation, process, and results when we tested against background noise and distance!
